=== KEY MODIFICATIONS MADE TO FIX DAMPING ISSUE ===

MODIFICATIONS TO FIX DAMPING ISSUE: damping was decreasing to zero then staying 
constant to zero through the whole iterations

1. Better initialization of damping and stiffness parameters
2. Added parameter regularization loss
3. Multi-phase training to gradually enforce physics
4. Constraint damping to physiological range

1. **Log Parameterization**:
   - Changed from direct parameters to log_damping/log_stiffness
   - Uses properties to ensure always positive values
   - Better gradients during training

2. **Parameter Regularization**:
   - Added parameter_regularization_loss() function
   - Keeps damping in 1-20 Nmâ‹…s/rad range
   - Keeps stiffness in 10-500 Nm/rad range

3. **Multi-Phase Training**:
   - Gradually increases physics and regularization weights
   - Prevents premature convergence to zero damping
   - Better balance between fitting data and physics

4. **Gradient Clipping**:
   - Prevents training instability
   - Helps maintain reasonable parameter values

5. **Better Initialization**:
   - Damping starts at 5.0 (reasonable value)
   - Stiffness starts at 50.0 (reasonable value)

6. **Validation Feedback**:
   - Reports if parameters are in physiological ranges
   - Shows reference lines in parameter evolution plots

These minimal changes should prevent the damping from going to zero while
keeping the same overall structure and functionality of your original code.

7. **README Generation**:
   - Added a function to generate README content with analysis summary.
   - Modified `analyze_multiple_files` to call the README generation function after each file is processed and save the file.
